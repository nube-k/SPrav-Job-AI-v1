Compress this massive raw SQLite log of yesterday's job hunting activity into a dense, 500-token Executive Summary.
Focus on:
1. Total metrics (Applied, Rejected, Ghosts Detected).
2. The most common Missing Skills (what do we need to learn?).
3. Any notable companies we applied to.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT hallucinate or infer numbers. Count exactly what is in the log.
- Do NOT invent companies that are not explicitly present in the log.

RAW SQLITE LOG ({target_date}):

Output ONLY the formatted Executive Summary in clean Markdown."""
